# == Class profile::analytics::cluster::users
#
# Installs any special system users needed on analytics namenodes or clients.
# This is used for ensuring that users exist for use in HDFS.
#
# NOTE: Puppet does not manage creation of system user HDFS home directories.
# you will need to do this manually.  To do so, run from any Hadoop node:
#   sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/$user && \
#   sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown $user:$group /user/$user
# And optionally:
#   sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chmod 775 /user/$user
#
class profile::analytics::cluster::users {

    # directories that it owns to analytics:druid. The Hive workflows/actions

    # that is moved and chowned as last step to its final location on HDFS.
    # If the analytics user is not in the druid group it will not be able (via Hive etc..)
    # to chgrp the final directory (and its files) to a group like 'druid'.
