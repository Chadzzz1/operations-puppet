# Profile class for adding backup functionalities to a host
#
# Note that the hiera key lookups have a name space of profile::backup instead
# of profile::backup::host. That's cause they are reused in other profile
# classes in the same hierarchy and is consistent with our code guidelines
#
# This profile class also does a small hack. It relies on
# profile::backup::enable being set to true before actually doing anything.
# That's because we can not provide meaningful default values for any of the
# other hiera calls, but still want to use the profile class in environments
# where backup is not set up. In that case we shortcircuit the class to be
# effectively a noop
