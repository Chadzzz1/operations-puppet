# NFS management script for labstore HA cluster
# This should be used to bring up a node as the active NFS server (primary DRBD)
# node, or to stop NFS and make a node DRBD secondary - which may be needed prior
# to rebooting a node, or during failovers.
#
# Usage:
# ./nfs-manage [up|down|status]
# up - Makes node DRBD primary, assigns floating IP, mounts drbd devices onto
#         fileserver, runs nfs-exportd, and starts NFS server
# down - Stop NFS server, unmounts drbd devices, makes node drbd secondary, removes
#         floating IP assignment
# status - Display mount and drbd status
