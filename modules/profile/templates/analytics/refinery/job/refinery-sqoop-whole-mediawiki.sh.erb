# This file is a wrapper running sqoop for whole mediawiki tables.
# It runs three sqoops in series:
#   * first sqoops tables necessary for the mediawiki history dataset from clouddb
#   * if successful, sqoops from the production replicas
#   * and finally, sqoops the remaining tables we care about from clouddb
#
# See each script referenced below for the list of cloud replica and prod replica tables
