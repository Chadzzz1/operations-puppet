#### This REST API service is used to manage toolforge replica.my.cnf.
#### It decouples the functionality of reading and writing replica.my.cnf files away from this repository and into its server environment.

# To Deploy
* Setup Nginx
* Setup gunicorn
* Run setup.sh

## Setup Nginx

* If you don't already have Nginx running on your server, you can follow [this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04) to setup Nginx.

* When you are done setting up Nginx, you can then add the below server block to your Nginx file.

```
log_format private '[$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer"';

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <domain name>;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log private;

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/<username>/replica_cnf_api_service/replica_cnf_api_service.sock;
    }
}
```
> **_NOTE:_** Remember to replace `<domain name>` and `<username>` with the appropriate values for your server.

## Setup gunicorn

* Follow [this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04) to see how to setup gunicorn for this project.
* For this project, the important part is to remember to use the below snippet for the systemd setup:

```
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve replica_cnf_api_service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=<username>
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/<username>/replica_cnf_api_service
Environment="PATH=/home/<username>/replica_cnf_api_service/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/<username>/replica_cnf_api_service/venv/bin/gunicorn "replica_cnf_api_service:create_app()" --threads=3 --timeout 155 --bind unix:replica_cnf_api_service.sock -m 007
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> **_NOTE:_** Always remember to replace `<username>` with the appropriate value for your server. Also, you should name your systemd file replica_cnf_api_service.service, or else an attempt to reload the server by the setup script will probably fail.

## Run setup.sh

* In the same directory containing this readme file, you will find a setup.sh script, run the script with `sudo ./setup.sh`
* create the path `/test_srv/shared/test_tools/home/test_tool` for testing purposes.
* the curl command below can be used to start interacting with your server over HTTP:
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"mysql_username":"Raymond_Ndibe","password":"my_password","file_path":"/test_srv/shared/test_tools/home/test_tool/replica.my.cnf","uid":0}'  http://localhost:8000/v1/write-replica-cnf
```
