    # Note: tg3 (Broadcom Tigon3): driver defaults to 4 RX queues and 1 TX
    # queue, and supports raising the TX queues to 4 optionally as well, but
    # there's a comment in the tg3.c source code that says this is a bad idea,
    # as hardware may under-perform under some scenarios with multiple TX
    # queues (large packets starving access to tx queues full of smaller
    # packets).  Best left at defaults here!
