# NOTE:  Cloudera does not (yet) provide Stretch packages.  We use the Jessie ones,
# along with a fake equivs to satisfy hadoop-mapreduce's (unnecessary) dependency on libssl1.0.0
# which is not available in Stretch.  Once Cloudera releases Stretch packages, we can
# use updates to mirror from Cloudera, rather than pulling them into stretch from
# jessie-wikimedia distribution.
