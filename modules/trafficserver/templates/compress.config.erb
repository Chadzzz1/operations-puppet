# Avoid compressing objects smaller than 860 bytes. We've seen varnish do
# gzipping on CL:0 302 responses, resulting in output that has CE:gzip
# and CL:20 and sends a pointless gzip header.
# Very small content may actually inflate from gzipping, and
# sub-one-packet content isn't saving a lot of latency for the gzip
# costs (to the server and the client, who must also decompress it).
# The magic 860 number comes from Akamai, Google recommends anywhere
# from 150-1000.  See also:
