class authdns::monitoring {

    #  its own fqdn, which won't generally be one of the listener
    #  addresses we really care about.  This gives a more-direct
    #  view of reality, though, as the mapping of listener addresses
    #  to real hosts could be fluid due to routing/anycast.

    # cause a single failed puppet run (until someone tries to deploy DNS
    # changes and gets blocked).
