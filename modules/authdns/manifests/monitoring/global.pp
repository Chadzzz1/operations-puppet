# == Class authdns::monitoring::global
# Monitoring checks for authdns, specific to Wikimedia setup
#

# This monitors the actual public listener IPs, regardless
#  of which authdns machines they're currently routed to.
# Obviously, its view will be limited to how they're routed
#  *from the monitoring machine*, which is imperfect but
#  better than nothing.

    $hostlabel = $title # just for semantic clarity below
