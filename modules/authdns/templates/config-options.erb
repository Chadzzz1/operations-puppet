# This file is managed by puppet, not the ops/dns repo!
# This whole file becomes contents of the options stanza of the final
# production configuration.  The stuff in the operations/dns repo owns the
# top-level config file which includes this!

# The options in this file should be about the runtime behavior of the daemon;
# things like listen addresses, thread/socket tuning, debug options, etc.
# Options that are more in the realm of the interpretation of zone data should
# be in the main config file's options stanza in the ops/dns repo.

# For now we listen on the any-addresses of both protocols
listen = any

# Use one thread+socket per physical CPU, per listen address, makes
# handling query-rate spikes even easier:
udp_threads = <%= @physicalcorecount %>
tcp_threads = <%= @physicalcorecount %>

# NSID for debugging the mapping of functional IPs to real servers
nsid_ascii = <%= @hostname %>

# Secret master key for cookie generation, shared by all the authdns fleet
cookie_key_file = /etc/gdnsd/secrets/dnscookies.key
