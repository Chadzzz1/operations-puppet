# Keystone policy exceptions
#
#  This file attempts to only include rules that differ from
#  upstream defaults.  To view the complete set of default rules
#  on a cloudcontrol node, run
#
#   oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace keystone
#
#  To detect redundant rules in our custom config on a cloudcontrol,
#  run
#
#   oslopolicy-list-redundant --namespace keystone
#


#  Many of these rule definitions will be judged redundant by
#  oslopolicy-list-redundant but they're included to provide
#  context for the policies that follow
"admin_or_owner": "rule:admin_required or rule:owner"
"admin_required": "role:admin or is_admin:1"
"service_or_admin": "rule:admin_required or rule:service_role"
"service_role": "role:service"
"projectadmin_role": "role:projectadmin"
"projectadmin_or_admin": "rule:admin_required or rule:projectadmin_role"


#  There are a few reasons why we override default policies:
#
#   - permissive policies ("") to allow the nova_observer user
#     to read things
#
#   - restrictive and projectadmin policies to distinguish between
#     a project member and a project admin (these aren't present in
#     keystone but are used elsewhere)
#
#   - restrictive admin-only policies that disable features we don't
#     use in wmcs
#

# keystone can't change passwords, it regards ldap as read-only.
