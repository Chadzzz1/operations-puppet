# Class for backwards compatibility.
# Previously eventschemas init.pp did only this.
# Since we now want to support multiple repositories,
# this class is used in place of the old one.
# This should be eventually be replaced with an eventschemas::repository define
# and used out of /srv/schemas/repositories/mediawiki.
