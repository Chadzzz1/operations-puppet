In order to run the tests, you need to install the following packages from
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/APT_repository:

- varnish
- varnish-modules
- libvmod-netmapper

libmaxminddb-dev also needs to be installed, any version will do.

Use run.py to test a Gerrit changeset against a given cache host. For example:

  ./run.py cp4022.ulsfo.wmnet 506868
