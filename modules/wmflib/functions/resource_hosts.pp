# @summary function to return a list of hosts running a specific resource
#  This function relies on data being present in puppetdb.  This means that new nodes will
#  be returned after their first successful puppet run using the specified resource.  It also means
#  that nodes will be removed from the results once they have been purged from puppetdb.  This currently
#  happens when a server has failed to run puppet for 14 days
# @param resource the resource to search for
# @param optional list of sites if present filter to output based on the sites passed
# @param resource_title the resource title to search for
