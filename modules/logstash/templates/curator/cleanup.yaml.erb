    description: >-
      Delete indices older than 91 days (based on index name), for <%= @prefix %>
      prefixed indices. Ignore the error if the filter does not result in an
      actionable list of indices (ignore_empty_list) and exit cleanly.

    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern

    description: >-
      For any indices prefixed by <%= @prefix %>, and have "index.routing.allocation.require.disktype":"ssd" set,

    action: forcemerge
    description: >-
      forceMerge <%= @prefix %> prefixed indices older than 2 days (based on index
      creation_date) to 1 segments per shard.  Delay 120 seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce.
      This action will ignore indices already forceMerged to the same or fewer
      number of segments per shard, so the 'forcemerged' filter is unneeded.
