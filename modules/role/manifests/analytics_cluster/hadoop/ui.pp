    # NOTE: We currently (2019-01) use Cloudera's Jessie .deb packages on
    # Debian Stretch.  This usually is fine, since most CDH packages are
    # JVM based. However, hue is a Python Django app, and has non JVM dependencies.
    # 2 of its dependencies are no longer available in Debian Stretch:
    # - libmysqlclient18
    # - libssl1.0.0
    # To work around this, libmysqlclient18 was manually downloaded and installed
    # on analytics-tool1001, and we created a Debian Equiv package for libssl1.0.0
    # (added to the cdh component).
