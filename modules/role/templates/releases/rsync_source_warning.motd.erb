releases.wikimedia.org has 2 backends, one in each data center.
It is serving traffic from both, active/active.

Though when you upload new files you need to use the right one
which is the source for automatic rsyncing to the other one.

This isn't the right one, this is the rsync destination, so don't
upload here, upload to the other data center.
