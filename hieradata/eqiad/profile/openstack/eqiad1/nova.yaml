# Nova is permitted to schedule new VMs on the following
#  hosts.  Nodes currently allocated for eqiad1 are
#  cloudvirt1001 through cloudvirt1030.

#   cloudvirt1001: depooled but ready
#   cloudvirt1002: depooled but ready
#   cloudvirt1003: depooled but ready

#   cloudvirt1007: pooled
#   cloudvirt1008: pooled
#   cloudvirt1009: pooled
#   cloudvirt1010: does not exist (formerly a leased system)
#   cloudvirt1011: does not exist (formerly a leased system)
#   cloudvirt1012: pooled
#   cloudvirt1013: pooled
#   cloudvirt1014: depooled but contains lots of VMs (Jessie, needs rebuild)
#   cloudvirt1015: depooled due to possible hardware issues -- T220853
#   cloudvirt1016: depooled but contains lots of VMs (Jessie, needs rebuild)
#   cloudvirt1017: depooled but contains lots of VMs (Jessie, needs rebuild)
#   cloudvirt1018: depooled, empty, emergency spare
#   cloudvirt1019: depooled, active host of database VMs
#   cloudvirt1020: depooled, active host of database VMs
#   cloudvirt1021: depooled but contains lots of VMs (Jessie, needs rebuild)
#   cloudvirt1022: depooled but contains lots of VMs (Jessie, needs rebuild)
#   cloudvirt1023: depooled but contains lots of VMs (Jessie, needs rebuild)
#   cloudvirt1024: depooled, empty, WIP (soon to be an emergency spare)
#   cloudvirt1025: pooled
#   cloudvirt1026: pooled
#   cloudvirt1027: pooled
#   cloudvirt1028: pooled
#   cloudvirt1029: pooled
#   cloudvirt1030: pooled

#  We're saving 1018 and 1024 as lifeboats 
#  because they have larger disks that will be big
#  enough to accept as refugees all the VMs from any other
#  virt host.
#
# There are some hypervisors that are visible to nova
#  but will never be in the general scheduler pool
#  because they're reserved for hand-created special-purpose
#  instances.  They are:
#
# cloudvirt1019 and 1020: reserved for cloud-wide DB instances
#
# cloudvirtanXXXX: reserved for gigantic cloud-analytics worker nodes
