# Override after T197062. The 2.2.6-wmf5 version depends on python-cassandra,
# but the most up to date version in jessie-backports is very far from what
# we have in Stretch. This mismatch breaks cqlsh on Jessie. aqs1004 has been
# already upgraded to 2.2.6-wmf5, so to please puppet we'll keep this special
# override until all the aqs hosts will be reimaged to Stretch.
