# cinder-backup servers for eqiad1 run in the codfw DC. In order to fully recreate
# the mirror setup, the cinder-backup servers for codfw1dev run in the eqiad DC.
#
# However, we have per-DC hiera with the ceph configuration and other hiera keys
# that we need to override. By the time of this writing, the role/ hierarchy has
# less precedence than per-DC data, so we need the keys here, which should have
# higher priority.
